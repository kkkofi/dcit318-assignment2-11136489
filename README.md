# DCIT 318 - Assignment 2

This project contains three C# console applications demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

1. **Inheritance & Method Overriding** – `Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`
2. **Abstract Classes & Methods** – `Shape`, `Circle`, `Rectangle`
3. **Interfaces** – `IMovable`, `Car`, `Bicycle`

Each task is implemented in separate classes and committed individually.  
A menu-driven version is also included in `Program.cs` for easy testing.
